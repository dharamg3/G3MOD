 - Ported to Linux kernel.
 - A "pool" is now a collection of contiguous memory regions.
 - Pool can dynamically grow and shrink.
 - Above chages required changes to TLSF interface for creating
   new memory pool.
 - Removed realloc(): No immediate requirement.
 - Other misc changes.

 - Add 64 bit support. It now runs on x86_64 and solaris64.
 - I also tested this on vxworks/32and solaris/32 and i386/32 processors.
 - Remove assembly code. I could not measure any performance difference
   on my core2 processor. This also makes the code more portable.
 - Moved defines/typedefs from tlsf.h to tlsf.c
 - Changed MIN_BLOCK_SIZE to sizeof (free_ptr_t) and BHDR_OVERHEAD to
   (sizeof (bhdr_t) - MIN_BLOCK_SIZE). This does not change the fact
    that the minumum size is still sizeof
   (bhdr_t).
 - Changed all C++ comment style to C style. (// -> /.
 - Used ls_bit instead of ffs and ms_bit instead of fls. I did this to
   avoid confusion with the standard ffs function which returns
   different values.
 - Created set_bit/clear_bit fuctions because they are not present
   on x86_64.
 - Added locking support + extra file target.h to show how to use it.
 - Added get_used_size function
 - Added rtl_realloc and rtl_calloc function
 - Implemented realloc clever support.
 - Added some test code in the example directory.
